                            <p>The first new blue pigment in 200 years was the last thing Oregon State University materials science students thought they would find.</p>
                            <p>In 2009, as part of his lab, materials science professor Dr. Mas Subramanian was working with students to manufacture new materials that could be used in electronics. They would mix and grind chemicals, then heat them to over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. One grad student, Andrew E. Smith, took a particular mix out of the furnace to find it had turned a surprising, bright blue color.</p>

                            <h3>The Science Behind It</h3>
                            <p>Scientists can’t technically create a new color, but they can create new materials that will refract and absorb light in new ways. Also fondly known as Oregon Blue and Mas Blue, YInMn Blue has a unique elemental structure which allows its manganese ions to absorb red and green wavelengths of light, reflecting back a deep but vibrant blue.</p>
                            <p>"YInMn Blue" (pronounced yin-min) is named after its chemical makeup of yttrium, indium and manganese oxides (YIn<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Since it derives from this mix of various metal oxides (a metal element combined with oxygen), it is considered a "complex inorganic pigment." That means it's not a naturally occurring pigment (such as ultramarine, which comes from the rock lapis lazuli). It is the first blue pigment to be synthesized in a lab in over 200 years, the last being cobalt in 1802.</p>

                            <h3>The Elusive Blue Pigment</h3>
                            <p>Blue is one of the rarest colours in nature, and creating it for the artist’s palette has been a challenge throughout history. The Ancient Egyptians were the first to make a synthetic blue pigment which could be used instead of a mineral blue pigment. Egyptian Blue, thought to be made by heating sand, copper, and lime, remained in use until around 800 AD, when the recipe for its manufacture was lost.</p>
                            <p>For centuries, the only source for blue pigments were minerals like Lapis Lazuli and Azurite, which were rare and expensive. When Lapis Lazuli reached Europe in the 13th century, almost all of it was extracted from mines in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the most expensive pigment used by artists due to its rarity and labour-intensive preparation. Because of this, it came to symbolise the divine in Renaissance Europe and was reserved only for the most important subjects – most notably for the robes of the Virgin Mary.</p>

                            <p>A tiny 1.3 oz tube of YInMn Blue currently sells for $179.40. To put that into perspective, 1.3 oz is the weight of about six grapes. The presence of the expensive metal Indium in YInMn makes it more expensive than other paints. The challenge, Subramanian explains, is to create yet another vibrant new blue pigment that is not only easy to manufacture and non-toxic (like YInMn) but also cheaper.</p>

                            <p>A blue pigment that is both safe and stable eluded the Egyptians, the Han Dynasty and the Mayans. The French developed cobalt blue in the 1800s, but it contains carcinogens. Prussian blue releases cyanide. Other pigments break down in hot or acidic conditions.</p>
                            <p>In tests, YInMn blue has proved to be more durable than cobalt blue, which tends to fade over time. Better yet, the pigment and its ingredients are completely nontoxic.</p>

                            <p>The intense, vivid, reflective compound of YInMn Blue holds promise as a heat- and acid-resistant pigment free of toxins. It is the first blue pigment ever made that can deflect heat.</p>
                            <p>Beyond its use in art, YInMn has also caught the eye of the industrial world. This color is so durable that even when placed in oil or water it does not fade which makes it an attractive and versatile commercial product.</p>
                            <p>"What fascinates me is how far it has gone from its modest beginnings," Subramanian says. "This rarely happens to something made in a science lab."</p>

                            <p>As a non-toxic, stable, durable and heat-reflective substance, it can easily be used for energy-saving coatings. Able to withstand extreme weather conditions, it can protect roofs from weathering while also improving energy efficiency since it allows homes to use less energy for cooling. In 2015, the Shepherd Color Company licensed YInMn Blue for use in a wide range of coatings and plastics.</p>

                            <p>Since their historic blue discovery, Subramanian and his team have successfully designed other durable colors - yellow, orange, green and purple - by tweaking the YInMn chemistry. The color missing in the palette is red. Red typically tends to come from heavy metals or other toxic substances, like mercury and lead so a better, non-toxic red pigment would be in high demand if found.</p>
