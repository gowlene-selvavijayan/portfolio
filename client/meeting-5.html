                <p>Our fifth meeting! Since we met after a few weeks had passed, we had a lot to discuss. Three prototypes have been uploaded up till this point and the website is mostly complete. We discussed setting up payments, linking the Original Manna Instagram feed to the website, looked into configuring the administrator email, took a tour of the website and went over feedback. Please see <a href="#action-items">Action Items</a> for tasks to be completed by next week.</p>
