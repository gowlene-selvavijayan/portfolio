            <h2>About the Series</h2>
            <p>The Owl House is an American animated fantasy television series created by Dana Terrace that aired on Disney Channel from <span class="no-wrap">January 10, 2020</span>, to <span class="no-wrap">April 8, 2023</span>.

                    <div class="coven-bio">
                        <p>The coven system was a system instituted on the Boiling Isles by Emperor Belos for categorizing magic into specific types. There were nine main covens â€“ plant coven, abomination coven, illusion coven, construction coven, bard coven, beast keeping coven, oracle coven, potions coven, and healing coven.</p>
                        <p>To public knowledge, the covens were introduced on The Titan's command, who communicated through Belos, to protect the witches and demons from the "danger" of wild magic (which in actuality is simply magic in its natural state). However, these claims were later revealed to be nothing more than an intricate series of lies concocted by Belos, to control the witches' collective power and pave the way for his plot to annihilate all magickind.</p>
                        <p>After The Collector's defeat and the downfall of Belos, the coven system was officially dissolved, leaving any and all witches free to pursue whatever magic they so choose.</p>

                        <p>A palisman (plural: palismen) is a sentient magical totem that sits at the top of a magic staff. They are usually made in the shape of an animal of some kind. A palisman contains a magical essence and harbors various magical properties, including the ability to switch between wooden and living forms at will.</p>
                        <p>Palismen can bond to witches, humans, and demons as a loyal companion, a powerful tool for channeling and amplifying their user's magic, and a method of flying transportation when in their wooden staff form. A palisman can also allow an individual with no innate magical ability, such as a human, to use magic, as the palisman has magic essence of its own that its bonded partner can utilize.</p>
