                <p>Spectrum Sensory Therapy is an Ottawa-based pediatric sensory therapy clinic and hub for children and youth, ages 0 to 18.</p>
                <p>We are a multidisciplinary team of occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, dieticians, psychologists, physiotherapists as well as arts-based and somatic therapists.</p>
                <p>We take a holistic, collaborative approach, working closely with caregivers, schools and other professionals to build a robust support system to help children thrive.</p>
            </section>

            <div class="neurodiversity">
            <p>Neurodiversity informs the different ways people experience the world and is not a deficit that needs to be labelled or "fixed". Our clinic is committed to providing affirming care to neurodivergent and disabled kids and supporting them in learning about themselves, feeling confident, and leading happy and fulfilled lives.</p>

                <p>At Spectrum Sensory Therapy, we are dedicated to our holistic, collaborative, community-based approach to curate a strong support network to ensure children in our care are equipped to better identify, understand and address their needs and feel empowered to reach their goals. Our mission is to enable kids to maximize their independence and have meaningful experiences, while providing services rooted in the following values:</p>
                <ul class="values">
                    <li class="value1">
                        <h3 class="h4">Compassion</h3>
                        <p>We approach every child and client with empathy and an openness to understand of our varied lived experiences. We know that every child deserves a safe, nurturing and affirming space to make them feel understood, supported and empowered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="value2">
                        <h3 class="h4">Equity</h3>
                        <p>We actively oppose and work to address racism, systemic oppression and inequity in all its forms and are committed to ensuring our services and supports feel safe, welcoming and valuable to all. We are dedicated to continually educating ourselves, challenging biases, and advocating for anti-racism and equity, so that every child feels valued and supported within our care.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="value3">
