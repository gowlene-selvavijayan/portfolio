<!-- WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES (WCAG) -->

<!-- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are an internationally recognized standardized series of guidelines and recommendations developed by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative. -->
<!-- The WCAG offers a framework of guidelines, recommendations, overall goals, measurable objectives, and testable success criteria to determine web accessibility conformance for web authors, designers and developers to create web content with accessibility front of mind. -->
<!-- The WCAG 2 is a series of 13 guidelines grounded in four principles – making web content Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. These principles are often referred to using the acronym POUR. -->
<!--

POUR: WCAG'S FOUR PRINCIPLES
============================

    1. PERCEIVABLE: User interface components and information must be presented to users in a way that is perceivable using at least one of their senses.

        For example, user interface components and information must be distinguishable. Visual presentations of text and images of text must meet the minimum contrast ratio of 4:5:1 or an enhanced contrast ratio of at least 7:1.

        Exceptions to this criteria are:
        - large text must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 or an enhanced contrast ratio of 4:5:1
        - text or images of text that are purely decorative, not visible to anyone, part of an inactive user interface component, or part of a picture that is made up of other visual content do not need to meet contrast requirements
        - a logo's text or brand name also does not have to meet contrast requirements

        Adhering to this guideline ensures that users with lower vision can tell colours apart and perceive all user interface components and information. Considering the contrast between foreground and background colours in your design makes web content more readable, understandable, navigable and thus accessible.

        You can check to see if your web content has enough contrast online, even by using free tools like Coolors: https://coolors.co/contrast-checker.

    2. OPERABLE:  Users must be able to navigate the interface and interact with it with ease.

        Users must be given enough time to read and process web content and its usage – and use it. For example, for time limits set by on-site application forms, at least one of the following must be true:

        a. Time limit can be turned off: the user can turn it off before encountering it
        b. Time limit is adjustable: the user is given the option to adjust with a wide range of at least ten times the default duration
        c. Time limit can be extended: the user is warned before it expires and given at least 20 seconds to perform a simple action to extend the limit, at least ten times
        d. Connected to a real-time event with no other alternative to the time limit
        e. Time limit is essential
        f. Time limit is longer than 20 hours

        Web content that follows this criterion ensures that all users, including users with disabilities who have slower processing speed or may need more screen breaks, can successfully undertake and finish tasks without unexpected changes in the web content as a result of a time limit.

    3. UNDERSTANDABLE: Users must be able to understand how to operate the user interface as well as its information.

        Web pages must look and behave in predictable ways. For example, the navigational mechanisms that are repeated across a set of web pages must be consistent and occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated unless the user makes a change to this themselves. An About or Contact page link cannot simply disappear on a navigation bar when moving from page to page.

    4. ROBUST: Web content must be compatible with and able to be interpreted by a range of "user agents", such as assistive technologies, browsers and other means of accessing web content. As technology advances and user agents evolve, users must continue to be able to access web content.

        For example, users may rely on assistive technologies for text-to-speech, dictation and voice recognition, and text magnification to access and utilize web content. To be robust, web content must be able to accommodate these various user agents even as they evolve so that users can continue to access content.
