                <p>The Spectrum team has made a significant impact on our lives and an invaluable support to our rainbow baby with cerebral palsy. They set us up with an intricate support system of people who truly care, see and believe in our kid. From sensory integration therapy and aqua therapy, to myofascial release and kinesio taping, to dry needling and muscle stimulation, this clinic has helped our kid gain strength, better posture, balance, flexibility, and most of all, has made them feel more autonomous and confident with every day. We are eternally grateful to have Spectrum Sensory Therapy in our corner.

                <p>Spectrum Sensory Therapy is a game changer. From implementing more flexible seating arrangements to facilitating accessibility training for our faculty. They have completely changed the culture of our school. Our classrooms feel brighter, more dynamic and open. Our teachers and staff feel more equipped like never before. Our kids are visibly more excited and energized coming to school every day. And we have had more engagement from families and more caregivers wanting to work with us to get to the root of kids' challenges in school and uncover their needs.</p>

                <p>When my daughter was finally diagnosed with autism, I was overwhelmed. I felt so isolated and unprepared. I wanted her to get all the care and all the opportunities she deserves. Spectrum Sensory Therapy made me feel less alone and connected me with other parents who were going through similar experiences. They helped me and my daughter find community. Now I have the tools to be my daughter's fiercest advocate.</p>
