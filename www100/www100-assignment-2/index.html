        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The CSS <code>position</code> property specifies how an element is positioned in a web document. Using this property, you can choose a method to visually organize and control the placement of web elements, the building blocks of your webpage.</p>
        
        <p>There are five different positioning methods, also known as position values. You can use more than one method at a time on a web document. Each value affects how an element is positioned in relation to either their normal position in the document flow, or another element.</p>

        <p>The <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> properties can help you move positioned elements in relation to either their normal position or another element. They are also known as box offset properties.</p>

        <p>Let's learn about the five different ways you can set an element's position and adjust it using box offset properties.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- .intro ends -->

        <!-- .main begins -->
        <div class="main">
        <nav class="navbar">
            <h3>The 5 position values</h3>
        <!-- use for anchor tags -->
            <ul class="positions">
                <li class="position value1"><a href="#static">static</a></li>
                <li class="position value2"><a href="#relative">relative</a></li>

                <li class="position value4"><a href="#fixed">fixed</a></li>
                <li class="position value5"><a href="#sticky">sticky</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

        <div class="not-navbar">
        <!-- STATIC section begins -->
        <section class="static">
        <h3 id="static">position: static; (default)</h3>
        <p>Static is the default value. Static positioning means the element remains positioned in the order it occurs, or in other words, according to the normal flow of a document.</p>
        <p>The browser assumes elements are statically positioned unless declared otherwise. It is the same as not setting the <code>position</code> property at all.</p>
        <p>Box offset properties like <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> have no effect on how static elements are displayed.</p>
        <p>Here is the HTML markup we'll use to explore this:</p>
        
    <pre>
        &lt;div class="box1"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;position: static&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="box2"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;position: static&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;top: 10px&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

        <p>Here is the CSS:</p>

    <pre>
        <span class="selector">.box1</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> static<span class="punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span>

        <span class="selector">.box2</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> static<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="comment">/* same as having no position set */</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 10px<span class="punctuation">;</span> <span class="comment">/* has no effect when static */</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>

        <p>What happens when the second box's position is set to <code>top: 10px</code>? You would think it would move down by 10 pixels, right?</p>

        <img src="img/position-static.png" class="img-static" width="1402" height="1240" alt="A blue rectangle box that says position: static in white font, sits on top a purple rectangle box of the same size with the same text. The purple rectangle also says top: 10px (has no effect in static position). There is no gap in between the boxes.">

        <p>It didn't move!</p>

        <p>When an element does not have its position set (in other words, it is positioned statically), box offset properties do not effect how it is displayed.</p>

        <p>Setting <code>top: 10px</code> will not have an effect on the second box unless its position is set to something other than static.</p>
        
        <p>Let's try changing it to <code>position: relative</code>. We'll dive into this position value next.</p>

        <pre>
        <span class="selector">.box1</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> static<span class="punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span>

        <span class="selector">.box2</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> relative<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 10px<span class="punctuation">;</span> <span class="comment">/* has effect when relative */</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>

        <p>Poof! There's a gap between the two boxes.</p>

        <img src="img/position-relative-1.png" class="img-relative-1" width="1402" height="1240" alt="A blue rectangle box that says position: static in white font, sits on top a purple rectangle box of the same size with the same text. There is a small, 10px gap in between them. The purple rectangle also says top: 10px (has effect in relative position).">

        <p>Now the second box is positioned 10 pixels down from where it normally would have been (as seen when it was statically positioned).</p>

        <p>Okay... <code>position: relative</code> made things work... but what does that mean?</p>
        <p>Let's get into it!</p>
        </section>
        <!-- STATIC section ends -->

        <!-- RELATIVE section begins -->
        <section class="relative">
            <h3 id="relative">position: relative;</h3>
            <p>Similar to static positioning, relative positioning sets the element in the order it occurs in the normal flow of a document. When a relatively positioned element has its <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, or <code>left</code> properties set, it adjusts itself in relation to its original position in the normal flow.</p>
            <p>In the example above, once we changed the second box to be relatively positioned, the <code>top: 10px</code> property finally had an effect. The second box moved 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.</p>
            <p>Let's look at another way we can use <code>position: relative</code>: in a parent-child relationship!</p>

            <p>Here's the HTML markup we'll be using:</p>

    <pre>
        &lt;div class="parent"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Parent Element&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;position: relative&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;div class="child"&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Child Element&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;position: relative&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

            <p>And here's the CSS:</p>

    <pre>
        <span class="selector">.parent</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> relative<span class="punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span>

        <span class="selector">.child</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> relative<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 0px<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">left</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 0px<span class="punctuation">;</span> 
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>

            <p>Now let's see what this looks like.</p>

            <img src="img/position-relative-2.png" class="img-relative-2" width="1380" height="1264" alt="A yellow rectangle box with rounded corners that says Child Element, position: relative, sits nested inside a bigger, orange rectangle with rounded corners that says Parent Element, position: relative.">

            <p>Look at that! The yellow box is nicely nested within its parent element, the orange box. Its box offset properties, <code>top: 0</code> and <code>left: 0</code>, make it sit flush against the top and left, positioning itself no further than the text within its parent element.</p>
            <p>Absolutely positioned elements, however, have a mind of their own!</p>
        </section>
        <!-- RELATIVE section ends -->

        <!-- ABSOLUTE section begins -->
        <section class="absolute">
            <h3 id="absolute">position: absolute;</h3>
            <p>Setting an element to <code>position: absolute</code> removes it from the normal flow of the document entirely. An absolutely positioned element positions itself with respect to the document body or its containing ancestor element.</p>
            <p>An element in <code>absolute</code> position <strong>must</strong> have either the <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> properties set to appear on the page.</p>
            <p>Let's change our child element's position and see <code>absolute</code> positioning in action!</p>
    <pre>
        <span class="selector">.parent</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> relative<span class="punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span>

        <span class="selector">.child</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> absolute<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 0px<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">left</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 0px<span class="punctuation">;</span> 
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>
            <img src="img/position-absolute-1.png" class="img-absolute" width="1402" height="1240" alt="A yellow rectangle box with rounded corners and black text that says Child Element, position: absolute, top:0 and left:0. The yellow box is covering part of an orange rectangle with rounded corners since its position is in line with the upper-left of the orange box. Most of the rectangle, including its text that says Parent Element, position: relative, is hidden">
            <p>The yellow box is no longer nested in its parent element! In fact, it's overlapping the orange box.</p>
            <p>Since the parent element (the orange box) is still set to <code>position: relative</code>, although the child element (the yellow box) has been taken out of the normal document flow, the child is positioning itself flush against the top and left edges of the orange box. And since it is now on an overlapping layer, it is even covering the text inside the parent.</p>
            <p>But what happens when we don't set the parent element's position at all?</p>
            <img src="img/position-absolute-2.png" class="img-absolute" width="1402" height="1240" alt="A yellow rectangle box with rounded corners that says Child Element, position: absolute, top:0 and left:0. It sits aligned with the upper- and left-most corner of the image. It is covering part of an orange rectangle with rounded corners that says Parent Element.">
            <p>Whoa! The yellow box completely flew out of its parent element!</p>
            <p>Why did that happen? When you take a child element out of the normal flow of a document using <code>absolute</code> positioning, it looks for a parent or the next closest ancestor element with an explicitly defined position (not static). If it cannot find a non-static ancestor element, the furthest ancestor element a child element will position itself in relation to is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>
            <p>Since the parent element's position was unset (static), the absolutely positioned child element had no containing block and broke out of the parent element to position itself in relation to the document's <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> (the furthest up the family tree it can go).</p>
            <p>Unlike relatively positioned elements, the space the absolutely positioned element would have occupied closed up without affecting the positioning of surrounding elements. In <code>relative</code> position, when box offset properties are adjusted, the space the element would have occupied in the normal flow is preserved and appears as visible empty space.</p>
            <p>Since absolutely positioned elements operate outside of the normal flow entirely, this positioning method comes in handy for when you need to develop isolated features that don't disrupt the layout of a webpage. For example, hamburger menus, pop-up boxes, control menus (like an accessibility toolbar), and much more!</p>
        </section>
        <!-- ABSOLUTE section ends -->

        <!-- FIXED section begins -->
        <section class="fixed">
            <h3 id="fixed">position: fixed;</h3>
            <p>Fixed elements are removed from the document flow and positioned relative to the viewport rather than another element in the document.</p>
            <p>An element in <code>fixed</code> positioning needs either the <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> properties set to appear on the page.</p>
            <p>To look at this, here's the HTML we're using:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;div class="fixed-element"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;position: sticky&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;top: 70px&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;left: 100px&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;lorem500&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>I'd recommend you add just enough lorem text so you can scroll! Here's the CSS we're working with:</p>
    <pre>
        <span class="selector">.fixed-element</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> fixed<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 70px<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">left</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 100px<span class="punctuation">;</span> 
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>

            <p>Feel free to adjust the box offset properties to your liking. Now let's see what happens!</p>
            <img src="img/position-fixed.png" alt="A lime green box with rounded corners and black that reads fixed: position, sits on top of a long paragraph of lorem ipsum text. It is positioned 50 pixels from the top of the viewport, and 40 pixels from the left.">
            <p>The green box is stuck in the same position, even when we scroll!</p>
            <p>This is what makes <code>fixed</code> positioning unique. Fixed elements behave similarly to absolutely positioned elements in that they function outside of the document flow on an overlapping layer. However, unlike absolutely positioned elements, <code>fixed</code> elements stay in one fixed position relative to only the viewport, even as the document scrolls. They do not position themselves in relation to other elements.</p>

            <p>What if you wanted to remain fixed, but only at a certain point in scrolling?</p>

        </section>
        <!-- FIXED section ends -->

        <!-- STICKY section begins -->
        <section class="sticky">
            <h3 id="sticky">position: sticky;</h3>
            <p>Sticky positioning falls in between <code>relative</code> and <code>fixed</code>.</p>
            <p>Similarly to both relatively and fixed positioned elements, <code>sticky</code> positioning also requires a <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> property to function, but the element will remain visible on the page.</p>
            <p>What does that mean? Let's find out!</p>
            <p>Here's the markup we're using:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;div class="random-element"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Random Element&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="sticky-element"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;position: sticky&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;top: 0&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;lorem500&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

            <p>And the CSS:</p>
    <pre>
        <span class="selector">.sticky-element</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="property">position</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> sticky<span class="punctuation">;</span>
            <span class="property">top</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> 0<span class="punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">}</span></pre>

        <p>A stickily positioned element initially behaves as though it is relatively positioned, setting itself in relation to its normal position in the document flow.</p> 

        <img src="img/position-sticky-1.png" alt="An orange rectangle box with rounded corners and black text that says Random Element, sits on top of a green rectangle box of the same size that says, position: fixed. There is a long paragraph of lorem ipsum text below.">
        
        <p>However, when scrolling, once you land on its specified position relative to the viewport, the element becomes fixed in position.</p>

        <img src="img/position-sticky-2.png" alt="The green rectangle box that says, position: fixed is positioned amidst the long paragraph of lorem ipsum text. The scroll bar is visible and shows that the document has been scrolled to its middle point while the green box remains fixed in position, pushed against the top of the viewport.">

        <p>When you return to its initial position, it behaves like a relatively positioned element again.</p>

        </section>
        <!-- STICKY section ends -->
        </div>
        <!-- .not-navbar ends -->
        </div>
        <!-- .main ends -->

        <section>
        <div class="pop-quiz">
            <h2>Pop Quiz!</h2>
            <div class="question">
            <p>What position value is the header on this page using?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reveal">Hover to reveal answer
                <div class="answer-1">static</div>
                <div class="answer-2">sticky</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h3 class="z-index">Introducing z-index</h3>
        <p>Once you start working within overlapping layers because of how the different position values behave, you will probably need to start ordering your overlapping elements.</p>
        <p>This is where <code>z-index</code> comes in!</p>
        <p>For it to work, an element's position must be explicitly set, so either <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, <code>fixed</code>, or <code>sticky</code>.</p>
        <p>Arrange the layout order of elements by using an integer value to set <code>z-index</code>. The higher the number set, the higher it will be in the order of elements.</p>
        <p>For example, to ensure a fixed or sticky navigation bar consistently moves on top of the rest of a web page's content, set the element's <code>z-index</code> to a positive integer. If no other element has its <code>z-index</code> set, <code>z-index: 1;</code> would work.</p>
        <p>To set an element behind another, you can also use negative integers, like <code>z-index: -1</code>.</p>
        </section>
